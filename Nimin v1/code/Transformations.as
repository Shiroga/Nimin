/*Transformations*/

/*
General overview: Each race has a "blood" value from 0-100, indicating how much of a race the player has. When one blood dominates over another (is higher), changes start to occur.
Other changes occur here as well, such as penis changes, boob changes, leg changes, outside of racial changes.

affinity - Long form method of changing multiple race bloods at a time.
aff - Short form where a specified race goes up, and all the others go down.
affinityChange - Where all the actual racial changes occur, could probably be split out into the different bodyparts.

cockChange - Determines when a cock changes to another race, or what a new cock should be.
cockLoss - Determines which cock should be lost, if there are multiple, based on blood values.
vagChange - Adds/removes vagoos appropriately, including pregnancy adjustments.
vagBellyChange - How much the belly changes with a bigger vagoo.
legChange - Allows for different leg-types to be added, independently of racial blood.
boobChange - Increases both breast and nipple size accordingly.
udderChange - Increases both udder and teat size accordingly.
udderCheck - Checking if an udder exists, since there's now multiple.
lactChange - Makes changes to base lactation value (not current milk storage).
